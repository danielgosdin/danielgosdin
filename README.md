- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielgosdin
- 👀 I’m interested in projects that help me to become proficient in Python (and eventually other programming languages), and I would like to learn more about feeback control systems engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and basic Raspberry Pi functionality
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to expand my portfolio to understand data analytics and feeback controls. I mainly want to learn how sensors talk to and respond to computers for some small hobby projects.
